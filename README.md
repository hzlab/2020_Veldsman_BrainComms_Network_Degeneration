# Network-degeneration-and-cognitive-decline
This repository stores codes for a manuscript titled degeneration of structural brain networks is associated with cognitive decline after ischaemic stroke.

Step1_Lesion_filling requires the Lesion Segmentation Tool (LST) (Schmidt et al., Neuroimage, 2012) for Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12). Please install both LST and SPM12 first.
Step2_VBM requires the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12) and SPM12. Please install CAT12 before running the scripts.
Step3_ROI requires MarsBar toolbox. Please install MarsBar before running the scripts.
Step4_SeedPLS and Step5_BehavioralPLS require an open source PLS software written in MATLAB. Please refer to https://www.rotmanbaycrest.on.ca/index.php?section=84 for downloading the toolbox.
